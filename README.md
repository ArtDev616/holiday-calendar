# Holiday Calendar

Holiday Calendar is a React application that displays public holidays based on country, year, and month selection. It fetches holiday data from an API and presents it in a calendar format.

## Features

Select a country to view public holidays specific to that country.
Choose a year to see holidays for that year.
Filter holidays by month to narrow down the results.
Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices.

Use the country, year, and month selectors to view the corresponding public holidays.

The calendar will display the holidays for the selected country, year, and month. If no holidays are found, a message indicating "No holidays found" will be displayed.

Feel free to explore different countries, years, and months to see their respective holidays.



In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
